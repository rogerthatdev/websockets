## An AI-guided project

I started here with a Deno code sample: 
[Deno HTTP server: WebSockets](https://docs.deno.com/examples/http-server-websocket/)

After that, I gave the sample code to ChatGPT along with this prompt:

```
let's expand this sample. Do not tell me the solution. only present me with the
assignment
```

I took the answer and added it to [ASSIGNMENT.md](./ASSIGNMENT.md). The plan is
to complete the assignment and then go back and ask for aonther assignment and
see where it takes me.
